In this directory, you can find a version of gr_modtool.py which works just
like the one in the directory above--but it's split up into lots ofmodules.

This makes editing and developing much, much easier. The gr_modtool.py which
contains all the stuff is actually auto-generated from here. To do that, run
make_fullscript.py.

There are some caveats:

* make_fullscript.py contains a list of files, in the correct order, which
  are simply pasted into the final gr_modtool.py. Anything up to a line
  with three hash tags ('###') is ignored in these files and thus only
  is needed for the split-module version.
* All imports which go into the final version are defined in
  fullscript_header.py, as well as the rest of the script header.
* The function get_class_dict() is actually redefined three times because
  it abuses Python scoping, and thus doesn't work when spread across
  modules. So if this function should ever be changed, it needs at least to
  be fixed in util_functions.py, because that's the version that makes into
  the final product (but should be changed in all cases).


The gr-newmod directory
=======================
This dir basically contains a copy of gr-howto-write-a-block from the gnuradio
sources, with some differences:
- All example blocks, apps, grc files (...) and references thereto in the the
  CMake files are removed
- In the top-level CMake file, the project is called 'gr-howto'.
